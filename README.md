## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB installed and a running instance.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Install server dependencies:

```
cd server
npm install
```

Install client dependencies:

```
cd client
npm install
npm nodemon ./index.js
```

nodemon will start the backend server

## üîß Running the tests For Backend <a name = "tests"></a>

for checking if routs are working properly use "Thunder client" or "Postman"

### Break down into end to end tests

To Ensure if backend is running properly

```
nodemon ./index.js
```

### For Frontend

In this we wre using Npm create-react-app

```
npm run start
```

The client should now be running on http://localhost:3000, and the server on http://localhost:5000.

To deploy your Notes App on a live system, you can use various hosting platforms and services. Below are general steps on how to deploy a MERN stack application.

1. Set Up a Production-Ready Build
   Before deploying, create a production-ready build of your React frontend. In your project's client directory, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of your React app in the build directory.

2. Choose a Hosting Provider
